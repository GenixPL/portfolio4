        <ArticleText text="I was responsible for the full development of the mobile applications (iOS and Android) implemented in Flutter. These were my first steps in Flutter and during the hundreds of hours I spent writing the whole app I learned a lot. Many things I would do differently now (architectural and widget), many things I used wrongly (e.g. Provider), but I've also managed to create components that I already copied to many other projects. One of them is my Navigator override, which I put from the beginning to 'every' new project (maybe one day there will be an article about it)."/>
