However, because I've been writing the second version only on my stronger computer, after firing it on a weaker computer and phone, I quickly came to the conclusion that Flutter Web still has a long way to go (and it is possible that the end will not be the happiest one :( ). So the decision was made to rewrite it in a proper web framework."/>
